# electric-powered-wheelchair
Exploring usability and user value of the Electric Powered Wheelchair (EPW). 

# Usability Evaluation
For usability evaluation, all evaluations were conducted after participants completed the EPW driving task.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to assess the usability, using a 5-point Likert scale (Brooke,1996).
Other assessment using the developed assessments: User Satisfaction Improvement, Spatial Efficiency, and ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations.

## The System Usability Scale (SUS)
|Number|Key words|Quesionnaire
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|I think that I would like to use this system frequently|
|2|I found the system unnecessarily complex|
|3|I thought the system was easy to use|
|4|I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able 5. to use this system|
|5|I found the various functions in this system were well integrated|
|6|I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system|
|7|I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly|
|8|I found the system very cumbersome to use|
|9|I felt very confident using the system|
|10|I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system|


2. User Satisfaction Improvement (IU)
3. Spatial Efficiency (SE)
6. ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations (SC)

# User value
To compare user value, user value measurement was structured into 10 sub-value constructs based on prior research (Park and Han, 2018; Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987).
These 10 sub-value structures were categorized into 4 dimensions (i.e. Openness to change, Self-enhancement, Conservation, Self-transcendence).
All scores were expressed using a 10-point Likert scale.

1. Self-direction
2. Stimulation
3. Hedonism
4. Achievement
5. Power
6. Security
7. Conformity
8. Tradition
9. Benevolence
10. Universalism
* Each of the 10 sub-value structures consists of score evaluations for Q1. Value pursuit and Q2. Value fulfillment after riding a power wheelchair.
Q1. *Value pursuit* I tend to seek this value. 
Q2. *Value fulfillment* The electric wheel-chair satisfy this value for me.
