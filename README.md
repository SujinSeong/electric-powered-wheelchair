# electric-powered-wheelchair
Exploring usability and user value of the Electric Powered Wheelchair (EPW). 

# Usability Evaluation
For usability evaluation, all evaluations were conducted after participants completed the EPW driving task.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to assess the usabil-ity, using a 5-point Likert scale (Brooke,1996).
Participants underwent usability as-sessment using the developed assessments: User Satisfaction Improvement, Spatial Efficiency, and ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations.

1. The System Usability Scale (SUS)
2. User Satisfaction Improvement
3. Spatial Efficiency
4. ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations

# User value
To compare user value, User value measurement was structured into 10 sub-value constructs based on prior research (Park and Han, 2018; Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987).
These 10 sub-value structures were categorized into 4 dimensions (i.e. Openness to change, Self-enhancement, Conservation, Self-transcendence).
All scores were expressed using a 10-point Likert scale.

1. Self-direction
2. Stimulation
3. Hedonism
4. Achievement
5. Power
6. Security
7. Conformity
8. Tradition
9. Benevolence
10. Universalism
* Each of the 10 sub-value structures consists of score evaluations for Q1. Value pursuit and Q2. Value fulfillment after riding a power wheelchair.
Q1. I tend to seek this value.
Q2.The electric wheel-chair satisfy this value for me.
