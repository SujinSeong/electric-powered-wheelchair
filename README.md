# Usability Evaluation
For usability evaluation, all evaluations were conducted after participants completed the EPW driving task.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to assess the usabil-ity, using a 5-point Likert scale (Brooke,1996).
Participants underwent usability as-sessment using the developed assessments: User Satisfaction Improvement, Spatial Efficiency, and ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations.
