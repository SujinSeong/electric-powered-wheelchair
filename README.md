# electric-powered-wheelchair
Exploring usability and user value of the Electric Powered Wheelchair (EPW). 
The following is a detailed description of the usability and user value assessment questionnaires used in this study.

# Usability Evaluation
For usability evaluation, all evaluations were conducted after participants completed the EPW driving task.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to assess the usability, using a 5-point Likert scale (Brooke,1996).
Other assessment using the developed assessments: User Satisfaction Improvement, Spatial Efficiency, and ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations.

## The System Usability Scale (SUS)
|Number|Key words|Quesionnaire|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Frequency|LearningI think that I would like to use this system frequently|
|2|Complexity|I found the system unnecessarily complex|
|3|Ease of Use|I thought the system was easy to use|
|4|Technical Support|I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able 5. to use this system|
|5|Integration|I found the various functions in this system were well integrated|
|6|Consistency|I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system|
|7|Learning Curve|I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly|
|8|Cumbersome|I found the system very cumbersome to use|
|9|Confidence|I felt very confident using the system|
|10|Learning|I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system|
* To calculate the SUS score, first sum the score contributions from each item.
* Each item's score contribution will range from 0 to 4.
* For items 1,3,5,7,and 9 the score contribution is the scale position minus 1.
* For items 2,4,6,8 and 10, the contribution is 5 minus the scale position.
* Multiply the sum of the scores by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of SU.

## User Satisfaction Improvement (IU)
|Number|Key words|Quesionnaire|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Versatility|I can use it in various situations and environments|
|2|Simplicity|The operation method is easy|
|3|Accessibility|Various users with different physical conditions can use it|
* Rate all items on a scale of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

## Spatial Efficiency (SE)
|Number|Key words|Quesionnaire|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Stability|I can use it stably in various postures|
|2|Portability|It is easy to carry (e.g., for placing in a vehicle)|
|3|Usability|It is usable in narrow spaces (e.g., in an elevator)|
* Rate all items on a scale of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

## ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations (SC)
|Number|Key words|Quesionnaire|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Trustworthiness|This device instills trust and reliability|
|2|Recoverability|This device is easy to recover from malfunctions or misuse|
|3|Feedback|This device provides appropriate feedback for interaction|
* Rate all items on a scale of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.


# User value
To compare user value, user value measurement was structured into 10 sub-value constructs based on prior research (Park and Han, 2018; Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987).
These 10 sub-value structures were categorized into 4 dimensions (i.e. Openness to change, Self-enhancement, Conservation, Self-transcendence).
All scores were expressed using a 10-point Likert scale.

1. Self-direction
2. Stimulation
3. Hedonism
4. Achievement
5. Power
6. Security
7. Conformity
8. Tradition
9. Benevolence
10. Universalism
* Each of the 10 sub-value structures consists of score evaluations for Q1. Value pursuit and Q2. Value fulfillment after riding a power wheelchair.
Q1. *Value pursuit* I tend to seek this value. 
Q2. *Value fulfillment* The electric wheel-chair satisfy this value for me.
