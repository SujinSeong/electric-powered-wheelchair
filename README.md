# Electric-Powered-Wheelchair (EPW)
Exploring usability and user value of the Electric Powered Wheelchair. 
The following is a detailed description of the usability and user value assessment questionnaires used in this study.
The specific characteristics are as follows
The device is rechargeable and can move up to 16 kilometers or more on a single charge. The platform is equipped with a stepping stool to help the user step on board. The angle of the backrest is adjustable, and the arm rests can be adjusted in height and angle. The device has a function as a cell phone holder, and it works in connection with a cell phone app. In this case, it is available with a dedicated app that can be linked to navigation and security cameras, as well as emergency rescue calls or location transmission when in danger. Moreover, it is equipped with a rear sensing sensor that functions as an alarm bell when there exists an obstacle behind. 
## Usability Evaluation
For usability evaluation, all evaluations were conducted after participants completed the EPW driving task.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to assess the usability, using a 5-point Likert scale (Brooke,1996).
Other assessment using the developed assessments: User Satisfaction Improvement, Spatial Efficiency, and ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations.

### The System Usability Scale (SUS)
|Number|Key words|Question|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Frequency|I think that I would like to use this system frequently|
|2|Complexity|I found the system unnecessarily complex|
|3|Ease of Use|I thought the system was easy to use|
|4|Technical Support|I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able 5. to use this system|
|5|Integration|I found the various functions in this system were well integrated|
|6|Consistency|I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system|
|7|Learning Curve|I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly|
|8|Cumbersome|I found the system very cumbersome to use|
|9|Confidence|I felt very confident using the system|
|10|Learning|I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system|
* To calculate the SUS score, first sum the score contributions from each item.
* Each item's score contribution will range from 0 to 4.
* For items 1,3,5,7, and 9 the score contribution is the scale position minus 1.
* For items 2,4,6,8, and 10 the contribution is 5 minus the scale position.
* Multiply the sum of the scores by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of SU.

### User Satisfaction Improvement (IU)
|Number|Key words|Question|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Versatility|I can use it in various situations and environments|
|2|Simplicity|The operation method is easy|
|3|Accessibility|Various users with different physical conditions can use it|
* Rate all items on a scale of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

### Spatial Efficiency (SE)
|Number|Key words|Question|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Stability|I can use it stably in various postures|
|2|Portability|It is easy to carry (e.g., for placing in a vehicle)|
|3|Usability|It is usable in narrow spaces (e.g., in an elevator)|
* Rate all items on a scale of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

### ICT-Integrated Safety and Convenience Systems evaluations (SC)
|Number|Key words|Question|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Trustworthiness|This device instills trust and reliability|
|2|Recoverability|This device is easy to recover from malfunctions or misuse|
|3|Feedback|This device provides appropriate feedback for interaction|
* Rate all items on a scale of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.


## User value
To compare user value, user value measurement was structured into 10 sub-value constructs based on prior research (Park and Han, 2018; Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987).
These 10 sub-value structures were categorized into 4 dimensions (i.e. Openness to change, Self-enhancement, Conservation, Self-transcendence).
All scores were expressed using a 10-point Likert scale.

|Number|Dimension|Sub-value structures|Definition|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|1|Self-enhancement|Power|Social power, wealth, authority|
|2|Self-enhancement|Achievement|Successful competent, ambitious, influential|
|3|Self-enhancement|Hedonism|Enjoying life, self-indulgence|
|4|Openness to change|Stimulation|Bold, colorful life, exciting life|
|5|Openness to change|Self-direction|Creativity, freedom, curiosity, independent, choosing oneâ€™s own goals|
|6|Self-transcendence|Universalism|Minded, beautiful world, social justice, peace seasons, equality, wisdom, unity with nature|
|7|Self-transcendence|Benevolence|Helpful, honest, forgiving, faithful, responsible|
|8|Conservation|Tradition|Respect for tradition, moderate, accepting my share in life, humble, devout|
|9|Conservation|Conformity|Obedient, respectful of parents and elders, self-discipline, courtesy|
|10|Conservation|Safety|National security, family security, social order, clean, returning favor|

* Each of the 10 sub-value structures consists of score evaluations for Q1. Value pursuit and Q2. Value fulfillment after riding a power wheelchair.
* Q1. *Value pursuit* I tend to seek this value. 
* Q2. *Value fulfillment* The electric wheel-chair satisfy this value for me.
